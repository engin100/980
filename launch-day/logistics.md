## Lab Access Windows (Nov 13-14)

- **Thursday, Nov 13:** The lab is open now and stays open until 7:30 p.m. Use this time to finish fabrication and assembly.
- **Friday, Nov 14 (3:30–5:30 p.m.):** Final office hours for fabrication/assembly. Put rechargeable batteries on the charger during this window. If you rely on disposable batteries, you will receive a fresh one before launch, but you must check one out from the IAs on Saturday.

## Saturday Morning Timeline

- The lab opens at **10:00 a.m.** on Saturday. Use this slot to gather materials, run quick pre-launch checks, and insert a clean microSD card.
- Do **not** attempt major code or hardware changes Saturday morning, and avoid any testing that could damage your payload—there will not be time to recover from issues.

## Launch Kit Pickup

- Each team will receive a launch kit on Friday containing an engine, igniters, plugs, and recovery wadding.
- Place your team parts box (clear tackle box) inside the purple cabinets on Friday so staff can load the launch materials.
- Every team starts Saturday with one engine. After the first round of launches we will redistribute any remaining engines to teams that need a second attempt.

## What to Bring to Mitchell Field West

Bring the essentials so you can debug on site after your first flight:

- Laptop computer
- microSD card reader
- Cable adapters and your programming cable

## Launch Schedule & Location

- Plan to arrive at the lab between **10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.** on Saturday. Launches begin around **12:00 p.m.** at **Mitchell Field West (softball fields).**
- We will monitor weather closely and send a Canvas + Slack Go/No-Go announcement by **9:30 a.m.** Saturday.
